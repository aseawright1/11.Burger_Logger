# Burger_Logger
 Track which types of burgers you'd like to eat, and which you've already eaten!

## What this project is
This project is an exercise in utilizing Handlebars and a homemade ORM to modify a MySQL database. Modifications are done using CRUD routes under the disguise of making, order, and (disappointedly) sending back bugers.

## Demo

## Why I began this project
I began this project as a way to strengthen my skills in database manipulation while still maintaining strict MVC guidelines in development. I also wanted to figure the ins and outs of how to fully deploy an app on Heroku with the JawsDB addon for MySQL.

## How I implemented this project
This project was implemented using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## What I hope to eventually accomplish with this project
I would like to expand the capabilities of the app, maybe adding a proper DELETE route as well as a way to build burgers on a per ingredient basis utilizing the same database to store toppings.
